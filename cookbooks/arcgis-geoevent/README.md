Recipes
-------

### arcgis-geoevent::admin_reset

Administratively resets GeoEvent Server.

> Deletes the Apache ZooKeeper files (to administratively clear the GeoEvent Server configuration), the productâ€™s runtime files (to force the system framework to be rebuilt), and removes previously received event messages (by deleting Kafka topic queues from disk) is how system administrators reset a GeoEvent Server instance to look like the product has just been installed.

> If you have custom components in the C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Server\GeoEvent\deploy folder, move these from the \deploy folder to a local temporary folder, while GeoEvent Server is running, to prevent the component from being restored (from the distributed configuration store) when GeoEvent Server is restarted. Also, make sure you have a copy of the most recent XML export of your GeoEvent Server configuration if you want to save the elements you have created.
