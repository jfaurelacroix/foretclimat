---------------------------------------------

## 1.  Prepare the machine for the installation
From your computer, ssh into the machine
```
ssh dti-a-idul@machine.ip.adress
```
Install Java, update and reboot
```
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install epel-release
sudo dnf upgrade
sudo reboot
```
Create the user used in the arcgis script
```
sudo useradd -m arcgis
sudo passwd arcgis
```
Install chef. type password when prompted.
Make sure to have the right version
```
curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P chefdk -c stable -v 4.13.3
```
Install git if not already installed:
```
sudo dnf install git
```

Create a folder for your repos and cd into it
```
mkdir repos
cd repos
```
Clone the git repos (ForÃªt-Climat and Esri's cookbooks)
```
git clone https://github.com/jfaurelacroix/foretclimat
git clone https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-cookbook
```
Inside the cookbooks folder, add necessary cookbooks from chef
```
cd arcgis-cookbook/cookbooks/arcgis-enterprise
```
Downloading the missing cookbooks (using Berkshelf)
```
cd ~/repos/arcgis-cookbook/cookbooks/arcgis-enterprise
berks install
mv ~/.berkshelf/cookbooks/* ~/repos/arcgis-cookbook/cookbooks
```
Rename every file
```
cd ~/repos/arcgis-cookbook/cookbooks
mv limits-* limits
mv hostsfile-* hostsfile
mv windows-* windows
mv windows_firewall-* windows_firewall
mv ms_dotnet-* ms_dotnet
mv nfs-* nfs
mv java_properties-* java_properties
mv aws-* aws
mv seven_zip-* seven_zip
mv line-* line
mv openssl-* openssl
mv tomcat-* tomcat
mv iptables-* iptables
mv s3_file-* s3_file
mv tar-* tar
mv apt-* apt
mv esri-iis-* esri-iis
mv esri-tomcat-* esri-tomcat
```
Make sure that you have all the required tar and license files available (in /opt/bkp_ArcGIS_files/)
- ArcGIS_Server_Linux_109_177864.tar.gz
- ArcGIS_Web_Adaptor_Java_Linux_109_177888.tar.gz
- apache-tomcat-9.x.x.tar.gz (will be downloaded from the internet if not present in the local ArcGIS software repository)
- openjdk-11_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz (will be downloaded from the internet if not present in the local ArcGIS software repository)

After following the globus guide to setup an endpoint on the machine,
transfer bkp_ArcGIS_files from Valeria to /opt

Make sure to have the authorization_files located at the right place
```
cd /opt/bkp_ArcGIS_files
sudo mkdir -p /opt/software/authorization_files/10.9
sudo cp ArcGIS_Enterprise_Portal_X.json /opt/software/authorization_files/10.9
sudo cp EducationSiteArcGISServerEnterprise_ArcGISServer_X.prvc /opt/software/authorization_files/10.9
```
Make sure the arcgis-enterprise-primary.json auth file match these files.

ArcGIS software repository directory is specified by arcgis.repository.archives attribute. By default it is set to local directory /opt/software/archives on Linux. However, it is recommended to create an ArcGIS software repository located on a separate file server that is accessible from all the machines in the deployment for the user account used to run Chef client.

Enable running sudo without password for the user running the Chef client.
Create the file structure
```
sudo mkdir /data/gisdata
```
Give rights to user
```
sudo chown arcgis /data/gisdata
sudo chmod 700 /data/gisdata
sudo chown arcgis -R /opt/software/
```
Change the limits for the user arcgis
```
sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf
```
Add the following lines:
```
#arcgis soft nofile 65535
#arcgis hard nofile 65535
```
## 2. Setup credentials
Locate the chef script you will need to use and move it to ~/repos
```
cp ~/repos/foretclimat/chef-json/* ~/repos/arcgis-cookbook/
```
Download jq. It's a tool to edit JSON 
```
sudo dnf install jq
```
Make credentials.sh executable and execute it. It will create a copy of each JSON as an encrypted file but the passwords will be there.
Ready to be decrypted and used with chef-client
```
cd ~/repos/arcgis-cookbook/
sudo chmod 700 ~/repos/foretclimat/scripts/credentials.sh
~/repos/foretclimat/scripts/credentials.sh
```


## 3.  Run the chef script
Enter the encryption password. It will decrypt the JSON, execute the installation and remove the decrypted file.
```
cd ~/repos/arcgis-cookbook
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -salt -in arcgis-enterprise-primary.enc -out decrypted.json -pbkdf2 && sudo chef-client -z -j decrypted.json && rm decrypted.json
```
You might want to set SELinux to permissive https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/using_selinux/changing-selinux-states-and-modes_using-selinux

SELinux might cause some issues and the script might crash. You might need to do things like this:

```
sudo chmod 700 /opt/arcgis/portal/startportal.sh
sudo chmod 700 /opt/arcgis/webadaptor10.9/java/tools/arcgis-wareg.jar
sudo ausearch -c '(ortal.sh)' --raw | audit2allow -M my-ortalsh
sudo  semodule -X 300 -i my-ortalsh.pp
```
You can run the script but if you need to kill it before the end, you should reboot the machine. 
Also, make sure that the hostname is the one expected in the license file.

## 4.  Notebook server installation
Prepare the archives
```
sudo mkdir /opt/setups/10.9
tar -xf /opt/bkp_ArcGIS_files/ArcGIS_Notebook_Server_Linux_1091_180226.tar.gz -C /opt/setups/10.9
```
Make sure that you have all the required tar files available (in /media/data/bkp_ArcGIS_files/)
- ArcGIS_Notebook_Docker_Advanced_109_177823.tar.gz
- ArcGIS_Notebook_Docker_Standard_109_177822.tar.gz
- ArcGIS_Notebook_Server_Linux_109_177908.tar.gz
- ArcGIS_Notebook_Server_Samples_Data_Linux_109_177914.tar.gz
- ArcGISNotebookServerAdvanced_ArcGISServer_1178969.prvc (authorization file)

Change docker's directory if needed (https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/notebook/latest/install/linux/install-docker-for-arcgis-notebook-server.htm)
and change file size limit for docker to work properly
```
ulimit -Sn 65535
```
Grab the authorization file
```
sudo cp /opt/bkp_ArcGIS_files/ArcGISNotebookServerAdvanced_ArcGISServer_1178969.prvc /opt/software/authorization_files/10.9/notebook_server.prvc
```
Copy the custom docker image to the location specified in notebook_server.json
```
sudo cp ~/repos/foretclimat/notebook/ArcGIS_Notebook_Docker_Advanced_Passerelle.tar.gz /opt/bkp_ArcGIS_files/
```
Installs Notebook Server, autorizes and creates site
```
sudo chef-client -z -j notebook-server.json
```
Installs Web Adaptor if not already installed, registers notebook with the WA
```
sudo chef-client -z -j arcgis-notebook-server-webadaptor.json
```
Federates Notebook with Enteprise Portal (PORT 7443 MUST BE OPEN)
```
sudo chef-client -z -j notebook-server-federation.json
```
Change the Image ID for advanced notebook to pick the custom one
```
sudo cp ~/repos/foretclimat/notebook/runtime.json /arcgis/notebookserver/framework/etc/factory/runtimes/Advanced/runtime.json
```
Change the image ID with the custom Advanced ID
```
docker images --no-trunc
sudo vi /gisdata/notebookserver/config-store/notebookruntimes/X #Where X is the numbers corresponding to the advanced notebook
```
## 5.  Setup the website and homepage
Create redirect to /portal/home
```
cd /opt/tomcat_arcgis/webapps
sudo mkdir ROOT
sudo sh -c "echo '<% response.sendRedirect(\"https://www.foretclimat.ca/portal/home/index.html\"); %>' > ROOT/index.jsp"
sudo chown -R tomcat_arcgis ROOT
sudo chmod 700 -R ROOT
```
Copy the files into /arcgis/portal/framework/webapps/arcgis#home/ also changes index to home
```
sudo mv /arcgis/portal/framework/webapps/arcgis#home/index.html /arcgis/portal/framework/webapps/arcgis#home/home.html
sudo cp ~/repos/foretclimat/pages/* /arcgis/portal/framework/webapps/arcgis#home/
sudo cp -r ~/repos/foretclimat/media /arcgis/portal/framework/webapps/arcgis#home/
```
#### Schedule notebook task
As arcgis user create the following directory
```
mkdir /gisdata/notebookserver/directories/arcgisworkspace/arcgisdata
```
Go to https://www.foretclimat.ca/portal/home/notebook/manager.html > Directories

Click on "+ Register Data Directory"

Name: data
Path: /gisdata/notebookserver/directories/arcgisworkspace/arcgisdata

Bind the data folder to the media
```
mkdir /arcgis/portal/framework/webapps/arcgis#home/media/graphs/
mount --bind /gisdata/notebookserver/directories/arcgisworkspace/arcgisdata /arcgis/portal/framework/webapps/arcgis#home/media/graphs
```

Then, import the notebook used for the homepage graphs.

After having saved the notebook,  the "Tasks" button becomes available in the top ribbon of the notebook editor.

Click on "Create Task", enter a Title and hit "Next".

For "Repeat Type" pick "Day". For "Time" pick "4:00 AM"
Make sure it is never ending and updates the notebook on completion.
